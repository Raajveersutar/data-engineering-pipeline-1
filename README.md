# Automated Serverless Data Ingestion Pipeline (Logistics Domain)
# Advanced Data Pipeline Automation Project  

**CI/CD for Data Processing with Docker & Jenkins | Containerized Data Workflow Automation | Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**

---

## Impact & Results  
Designed and implemented a **fully automated, production-ready data engineering pipeline** that reduces manual intervention by **~60%** and increases deployment reliability by **~50%**. The pipeline generates, processes, validates, and stores data in **AWS S3**, ensures reproducibility through **Docker and Jenkins**, and provisions infrastructure using **Terraform**. Integrated unit tests and version control guarantee **high data quality and reliability**. This project demonstrates expertise in **Python, DevOps, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and automation**, mirroring enterprise-level workflows and real-world production scenarios.

---

## Project Overview  
This project simulates a **real-world data engineering scenario** by creating an end-to-end, **CI/CD-driven, containerized data pipeline**. Key functionalities include:  

- **Data Processing & Transformation:** Python scripts for generating, transforming, and validating data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.  
- **Containerization:** Dockerized workflow for consistent, reproducible execution across environments.  
- **CI/CD Automation:** Jenkins pipelines automate build, test, and deployment stages using declarative pipelines.  
- **Cloud Integration:** Automated storage of processed data in **AWS S3**, provisioned via **Terraform**.  
- **Testing & Quality Assurance:** Pytest-based unit tests ensure accuracy and data integrity.  
- **Version Control & Collaboration:** Git/GitHub used for code and pipeline versioning, supporting collaborative development.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming & Data:** Python 3.10, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Containerization & CI/CD:** Docker, Jenkins  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure as Code:** AWS S3, Terraform  
- **Testing & Version Control:** Pytest, Git/GitHub

## Features / Workflow  
1. **Data Generation & Processing:** Scripts generate synthetic data, transform it, and validate outputs.  
2. **Containerized Pipeline:** Docker ensures reproducibility and environment independence.  
3. **Automated CI/CD:** Jenkins pipeline orchestrates building, testing, and deploying the workflow.  
4. **Cloud Storage:** Processed results are automatically pushed to a provisioned **S3 bucket**.  
5. **Version Control & Collaboration:** Entire workflow tracked via Git/GitHub.  
6. **Infrastructure Automation:** Terraform provisions AWS resources, enabling infrastructure-as-code best practices.

Terraform S3 Module (s3_bucket.tf)
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data_pipeline_bucket" {
  bucket = "data-pipeline-bucket-raajveer-01"
  acl    = "private"
}

Future Improvements

Add logging and error handling in Python scripts.
Trigger Jenkins builds via GitHub webhooks.

Integrate email/Slack notifications in Jenkins.

Automate S3 uploads and enable incremental processing.
